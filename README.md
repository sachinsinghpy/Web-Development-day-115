React Router
What is React Router?
React Router is a library that provides routing capabilities for React applications.

Routing means handling navigation between different views.

React Router is the standard routing library for React applications. It enables you to:

Create multiple pages in your single-page application
Handle URL parameters and query strings
Manage browser history and navigation
Create nested routes and layouts
Implement protected routes for authentication
Without a router, your React application would be limited to a single page with no way to navigate between different views.

Install React Router
In the command line, navigate to your project directory and run the following command to install the package:

npm install react-router-dom
